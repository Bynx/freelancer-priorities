#Freelancer Priorities
A basic application to help freelancers prioritize their projects by:
- Name and Email address of the client
- Is the project in person or remote?
  - Location of the request (if physical)
  - Distance from the headquarters of the freelancer (if physical)
- Date of the request
- Date of the requested completion
  - Is this flexible? (boolean value true/false)
- Size of project (integer 1-10 with 10 being largest?)
- Complexity of project (integer 1-10 with 10 being largest)
- Time required for preparation/planning
- Time required to complete the project after preparation/planning
- Potential revenue
- Potential cost of project
  - Preparation/planning cost
  - Material cost
  - Labor cost
  - Travel cost
- Calculated potential profit
- Interest in project (integer 1-10 with 10 being highest interest)
- List of other potential projects that may conflict with the timeline


When a project is chosen to start:
- Cancel/reschedule projects that conflict with the current project
  - To complete this cancellation/reschedule, the freelancer will fill out a form on the application to email the client, notifying them of the reschedule/cancellation. The client will be provided a calendar showing the dates and times they may choose based on the freelancer's current project schedule. They may also choose to cancel the project.
  - If the client is notified outside of the application, allow the freelancer to manually reschedule or cancel the project.
  - To prevent clients from rescheduling outside of work hours, keep a record of the freelancer's working hours on their account.
    - Allow the freelancer to mark time off, half days, holidays, days off, etc.
    - When the freelancer takes a sick/emergency time off, automatically reschedule all projects and notify the clients that their dates have to be pushed by x days?
